## Tech Stack

**Client:** Typescript, React, Next.js, Redux, TailwindCSS,

**Server:** Typescript, Node.js, Express, TypeORM, PostgreSQL

### Why 
Typescript: Type safety and more robust code, over improves the developer workflow and productivity.

Next.js: The out of the box server side rendering capabilites will allow us to send less code to the user, which makes the app faster. More SEO friendly, we want our posts to be indexed by search engines for better discoverability for example.

Express: Web framework of choice, to handle all the routes for the API and pages. Can add middleware to operate on the server side.

TypeORM: Works with SQL based database nicely (PostgreSQL), very easy to use with Typescript.
